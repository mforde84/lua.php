Purpose
-------
This module file defines the system paths and environment variables
needed to use nonmem 7.3


Product Description
-------------------
The gold standard software in Population Pharmacokinetic and 
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic modelling.
The software consists of three parts.

    * The NONMEM速 progrm
      The NONMEM速 program itself is a very general(non-interactive) 
model analysis program that can be used to fit models to many different 
types of data. With version 7, Monte Carlo expectation-maximization and 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian methods have been added to the 
classical likelihood methods available in previous versions. NONMEM速
 can be used to simulate data as well as fit data.

    * PREDPP
      PREDPP is a powerful package of subroutines that can be used by 
NONMEM速 to compute predictions for population pharmacokinetic and
 pharmacodynamic data. Use of PREDPP obviates the need for the user to 
code kinetic-type equations and it also allows complicated patient-type 
data to be easily used. However, the user can also directly and very 
generally code prediction-type, likelihood or -2 log-likelihood equations, 
and thus a great variety of different types of models can be used.

    * NM-TRAN
      NM-TRAN is (non-interactive) preprocessor, allowing control and 
other needed inputs to NONMEM/PREDPP to be specified in a user friendly 
manner, with quick and comprehensive detection of a variety of errors 
that the user may have made in so doing.
